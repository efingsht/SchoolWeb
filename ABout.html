            <p>The BRIT School is a one of a kind FREE Performing Arts and Technology School. It is an independent state funded City College for the Technology of the Arts, dedicated to education and vocational training for the performing arts, media, art and design and the technologies that make performance possible.

<br>As a school for 14 to 19-year-olds, we are unique and pioneering in our approach to education, but we are not a stage or fame school. We recognise that most of our students intend to make a career in the arts, entertainment and communications industries, but the school expects all to follow full time courses to completion. It is a vocational school; if an applicant is determined on a life devoted to art, dance, music, musical theatre, radio, television/film or theatre, then this could well be the right place.

We also pride ourselves on providing an excellent general education that helps prepare young people for the future. We encourage our students to go on to specialist colleges and universities or into employment in the creative industries. Indeed the majority do so.

If we are devoted to the arts, then we also recognise that the technology of our title is essential for a complete education. We have formidable resources to allow students to study in sophisticated environments equivalent to a modern workplace. BRIT stands for the British Record Industry Trust. Without the generosity of the record industry, the school would never have been built and our superb facilities would never have been installed. Furthermore, we greatly benefit from the advice and support given to students and staff from our wide range of friends in the music and wider arts industries.

The school has a unique atmosphere of support and respect, which helps cultivate the ability and talent of our young people. Students and staff have created an open, friendly, flexible, yet rigorous approach to study. Our achievements at both Key Stage 4 and Post-16 in vocational and academic qualifications testify to our success, as does the range of successful ex-students now working and studying in the creative industries.</p>
